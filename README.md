Hypotheses 

By modulating the RoPE frequencies based on pitch (F0), we are essentially telling the model to pay attention to the acoustic features relate to sequence position in a way that's proportional to the voice characteristics.  This approach creates a more speech-aware positional representation that helps the model better understand the relationship between acoustic features and text.

To highlight the relationship between pitch and rotary embeddings the model implements three complementary pitch-based enhancements:

1. The first uses pitch to modify theta (rotary frequency)*
2. The second adds direct similarity bias to attention
3. Variable radii added in place of unit circle radius(1.0) of torch.polar. The frequencies (f0) are time aligned with tokens creating acoustically-weighted positional encodings where the "loudness" of each position in the embedding space reflects the acoustic prominence in the original speech.

Each figure shows 4 subplots (one for each of the first 4 dimensions of your embeddings in the test run). These visualizations show how pitch information modifies position encoding patterns in the model.

In each subplot:

- **Thick solid lines**: Standard RoPE rotations for even dimensions (no F0 adaptation)
- **Thick dashed lines**: Standard RoPE rotations for odd dimensions (no F0 adaptation)
- **Thin solid lines**: F0-adapted RoPE rotations for even dimensions
- **Thin dashed lines**: F0-adapted RoPE rotations for odd dimensions


1. **Differences between thick and thin lines**: This shows how much the F0 information is modifying the standard position encodings. Larger differences indicate stronger F0 adaptation.

2. **Pattern changes**: The standard RoPE (thick lines) show regular sinusoidal patterns, while the F0-adapted RoPE (thin lines) show variations that correspond to the audio's pitch contour.

3. **Dimension-specific effects**: Compared across four subplots to see if F0 affects different dimensions differently.

4. **Position-specific variations**: In standard RoPE, frequency decreases with dimension index, but F0 adaptation modify this pattern.

```python

 freqs = (theta / 220.0) * 700 * (torch.pow(10, torch.linspace(0, 2595 * torch.log10(torch.tensor(1 + 8000/700)), dim // 2, device=device, dtype=dtype) / 2595) - 1) / 1000
```

The patterns below show how positions "see" each other in relation to theta and f0. 

Bright diagonal line: Each position matches itself perfectly.
Wider bright bands: Positions can "see" farther (good for long dependencies) but can be noisy.
Narrow bands: More focus on nearby positions (good for local patterns)
